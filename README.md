# Crystal-Collector-Game

This game generates a random number displayed in the center of the screen in red.

You get to choose from 4 crystals that each contain a hidden and varied number value.
Upon clicking a crystal, the hidden value will be added to the blue number. 

In order to win, you must use the 4 crystals to add up to the sum of the red number.
If your sum goes over the red number, you lose!
After a win or loss, the hidden values in the crystal will randomly change, along with the red number.
